The Health Extension Regional Officers (HEROs) program at the University of New Mexico described in this issue of the <i>JABFM</i> is an innovative model with a bidirectional approach to linking academic health centers to community-based practices and organizations. Health extension programs are local, influenced by history, relationships, and support. Oregon9s health extension workforce represents a diverse group that includes practice facilitators, community health workers, and Cooperative Extension agents. PBRNs are measuring success in terms of collaboration across a spectrum of health activities. The Oregon Rural Practice-based Research Network uses a “Four Pillars” model of community engagement, practice transformation, research, and education to involve researchers, health policy experts, educators, and health extension workers to improve community health.</p>",
